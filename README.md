## SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES :computer: :brain:
### PYTHON DEPENDENCIES
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) <br>
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.  

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) <br>
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) <br>
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) <br>
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

### MATLAB DEPENDENCIES
* [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) <br>
MATLAB is the easiest and most productive computing environment for engineers and scientists. With math, graphics, and programming, it's designed for the way you think and the work you do.
