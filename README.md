## SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES :computer: :brain:
### PYTHON DEPENDENCIES
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) <br>
Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more effectively.  

* [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) <br>
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) <br>
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) <br>
Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

### MATLAB DEPENDENCIES
* [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com/) <br>
MATLAB is the easiest and most productive computing environment for engineers and scientists. With math, graphics, and programming, it's designed for the way you think and the work you do.

* [Simulink](https://la.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html) <br>
Simulink is the platform for Model-Based Design that supports system-level design, simulation, automatic code generation, and continuous test and verification of embedded systems.

* [System Identification Toolbox](https://la.mathworks.com/help/ident/) <br>
System Identification Toolbox™ provides MATLAB® functions, Simulink® blocks, and an app for constructing mathematical models of dynamic systems from measured input-output data. It lets you create and use models of dynamic systems not easily modeled from first principles or specifications. You can use time-domain and frequency-domain input-output data to identify continuous-time and discrete-time transfer functions, process models, and state-space models. The toolbox also provides algorithms for embedded online parameter estimation.

* [Econometrics Toolbox](https://la.mathworks.com/help/econ/index.html) <br>
Econometrics Toolbox™ provides functions for analyzing and modeling time series data. It offers a wide range of visualizations and diagnostics for model selection, including tests for autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity, unit roots and stationarity, cointegration, causality, and structural change. You can estimate, simulate, and forecast economic systems using a variety of modeling frameworks. These frameworks include regression, ARIMA, state-space, GARCH, multivariate VAR and VEC, and switching models. The toolbox also provides Bayesian tools for developing time-varying models that learn from new data.
